# React-Respond-Reflect Dialogues Dataset üé≠

A curated collection of dialogues demonstrating empathetic conversation patterns using the React-Respond-Reflect framework. This dataset is designed to help train conversational AI models in providing emotionally intelligent and structured responses.

## Dataset Description üìä

### Overview
The dataset contains dialogues between users and a virtual human, where each response follows a three-part structure:
- **React**: Physical/emotional reactions expressed through actions and body language
- **Respond**: The actual verbal response to the user
- **Reflect**: Internal thoughts and analysis of the conversation

### Format
Each dialogue is structured as follows:
```json
{
    "conversation_id": "unique_id",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "user message"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "virtual human response with react/respond/reflect tags"
        }
    ],
    "num_turns": "number of back-and-forth exchanges"
}
```

### Key Features üåü

```

## Dataset Creation üõ†Ô∏è

### Curation Rationale
The dialogues were carefully curated to demonstrate effective emotional support and structured conversation patterns. Each dialogue showcases the React-Respond-Reflect framework in action, providing clear examples of empathetic communication.

### Source Data
Original dialogues were created and refined through an iterative process, focusing on common scenarios where emotional support and structured responses are beneficial.

### Annotations
The dataset uses XML-style tags to annotate different components of responses:
- `<react>`: Physical and emotional reactions
- `<respond>`: Verbal responses
- `<reflect>`: Internal analysis and thoughts

## Considerations for Use ü§î

### Social Impact
This dataset aims to improve the quality of AI-human interactions by promoting:
- Emotional intelligence in conversational AI
- Structured yet natural dialogue patterns
- Empathetic response frameworks
- Clear communication practices

### Discussion of Biases
While efforts have been made to create balanced and helpful dialogues, users should be aware that:
- The dataset reflects specific communication patterns and strategies
- Cultural context may influence interpretation
- The structured format may not suit all conversation styles
